# AI-DLC Documentation

AI-DLC is a structured, gated methodology for AI-driven software development.
This repository runs it natively in Claude Code, Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE, Codex CLI,
Cursor, opencode, and GitHub Copilot.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/telgue/aidlc/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/telgue/aidlc/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

The native installer includes every harness runtime and does not require Bun or
Node.js.

### 2. Configure

Run from your project root:

```bash
aidlc config --harness claude
aidlc doctor
```

Replace `claude` with `kiro`, `kiro-ide`, `codex`, `cursor`, `opencode`, or
`copilot`. A bare `aidlc config` starts the interactive setup.

### 3. Start

Open the configured harness and describe the work:

```text
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

Codex CLI uses `$aidlc`. See [Getting Started](guide/01-getting-started.md) for
provider setup, trust prompts, project refreshes, and the first workflow.

## Development

Maintainers author in `core/` and `harness/`. Generated `dist/` and
`dist-release/` trees are local outputs and must not be hand-edited.

See the [Contributing Guide](reference/11-contributing.md) for the development
workflow and [Porting to a New Harness](harness-engineering/09-porting-to-a-new-harness.md)
to add another runtime.
